Experiments with Go with webscraping

This is a repo just to get familiar and play around with some Go syntax, by working with some webscraping from a pes website


Some manual steps are needed (todo to figure out how to abstract away)
1. `export GOPATH=$HOME/gocode`
2. `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`
3. `go get github.com/anaskhan96/soup`
4. `go run download_pes.go`
